    "\n",
    "**Capstone Project for 5-day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google (Apr 2025)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To create an AI assistant capable of analyzing Solidity smart contracts for common security vulnerabilities and gas optimization opportunities, leveraging Google's Gemini model, custom analysis tools, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:** This notebook utilizes the direct `google-generativeai` Python library for interaction with the Gemini Pro model (`models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest`). This approach was chosen for stability after encountering persistent hanging issues with the `langchain-google-genai` wrapper in the Kaggle environment during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assistant works by:\n",
    "1.  Running basic pattern-matching tools (`VulnerabilityAnalysisTool`, `GasOptimizerTool`) on the input Solidity code.\n",
    "2.  Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to find descriptions of known vulnerabilities similar to the input code/findings.\n",
    "3.  Feeding the original code, tool outputs, and RAG results into the Gemini model via a structured prompt.\n",
    "4.  Asking the Gemini model to act as a Web3 Security Researcher and synthesize a comprehensive analysis, including explanations of risks and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gen AI Capabilities Demonstrated:**\n",
    "* **Function Calling:** Defining and using specialized tools (`VulnerabilityAnalysisTool`, `GasOptimizerTool`) to perform specific analysis tasks.\n",
    "* **Embeddings:** Generating vector embeddings for a knowledge base of vulnerability descriptions using Google's embedding model.\n",
    "* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Retrieving relevant known vulnerability information based on input code similarity to enhance the LLM's context.\n",
    "* **Vector Search/Similarity:** Using cosine similarity to find the most relevant items from the embedded knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requires:** A Google AI API Key stored as a Kaggle Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`."

       "\n",
       "This report details the security analysis of the `VulnerableBank` contract based on the provided code and tool outputs.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Identified Vulnerabilities:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Reentrancy:** The `withdraw()` function is susceptible to reentrancy attacks.  The external call `msg.sender.call{value: amount}(\"\")` is made *before* updating the user's balance (`balances[msg.sender] = 0`).  A malicious contract could call back into the `withdraw()` function within the external call, repeatedly draining funds before the balance is zeroed.  This is a critical vulnerability.\n",
       "    * **Code Snippet:**\n",
       "    ```solidity\n",
       "    function withdraw() public {\n",
       "        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];\n",
       "        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}(\"\"); // External call before state update\n",
       "        balances[msg.sender] = 0; // State update after external call\n",
       "    }\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "    * **Risk:** Complete loss of funds in the contract.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Unchecked Return Value:** The `withdraw()` function does not check the return value of the low-level call `msg.sender.call{value: amount}(\"\")`. The `success` boolean is ignored. If the call fails for any reason (e.g., the recipient contract reverts), the `withdraw()` function proceeds as if the transfer was successful, setting the user's balance to zero even though the funds were not transferred. This can lead to inconsistencies in the contract's state and potential loss of user funds.\n",
       "    * **Code Snippet:**\n",
       "    ```solidity\n",
       "    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}(\"\"); // success is not checked\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "    * **Risk:** Loss of user funds if the external call fails.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Gas Optimizations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "No gas optimization opportunities were identified by the tool. However, using the `Checks-Effects-Interactions` pattern in the `withdraw` function (updating the state *before* making the external call) inherently reduces gas costs associated with potential reentrancy mitigations like reentrancy guards.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Overall Assessment:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The contract has critical security vulnerabilities, primarily the reentrancy vulnerability in the `withdraw()` function, making it highly insecure. The unchecked return value further exacerbates the risk.  Deployment in its current state is strongly discouraged.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Mitigate Reentrancy:** Implement the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Update the user's balance *before* making the external call:\n",
       "    ```solidity\n",
       "    function withdraw() public {\n",
       "        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];\n",
       "        balances[msg.sender] = 0; // State update before external call\n",
       "        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}(\"\"); // External call\n",
       "        require(success, \"Transfer failed.\"); // Check return value\n",
       "    }\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "2. **Check Return Values:** Always check the `success` boolean returned by low-level calls like `.call()`.  Use `require(success, \"Transfer failed.\");` to revert the transaction if the call fails. This is already included in the code snippet above.\n",
       "3. **Consider Reentrancy Guards:** While the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern is preferred, consider using a reentrancy guard (e.g., a boolean flag or a mutex) as an additional layer of protection, especially in complex contracts.\n",
       "4. **Thorough Testing:** Conduct extensive testing, including unit tests and fuzzing, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before deployment.  Specifically, test the `withdraw()` function with a malicious contract that attempts a reentrancy attack.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "By addressing these issues, the security posture of the `VulnerableBank` contract can be significantly improved.\n"

    "## Appendix: Notes on LangChain Agent Attempt\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, this project attempted to use a LangChain ReAct Agent (`langchain.agents.create_react_agent` with `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`). However, during development and testing within the Kaggle Notebook environment (as of April 2025), persistent issues were encountered where calls to the LangChain agent executor (`agent_executor.invoke`) or direct calls to the LangChain LLM wrapper (`llm.invoke`) would hang indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "This occurred despite:\n",
    "* Using confirmed valid API keys.\n",
    "* Using model names confirmed available via `genai.list_models()`.\n",
    "* Applying environment variable workarounds (`NO_GCE_CHECK=True`, etc.) intended to mitigate issues related to Kaggle's restricted environment potentially interfering with Google library metadata checks.\n",
    "* Confirming that direct calls using the base `google-generativeai` library *were* successful with the same setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traceback during hangs pointed to waits deep within the underlying `grpc` library's network communication layer. This suggests a potential incompatibility or bug within the `langchain-google-genai` wrapper's handling of API calls or authentication flows specifically within this Kaggle environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these unresolved issues and the project deadline, the primary implementation was switched to use the **direct `google-generativeai` library calls**, orchestrated by the `analyze_contract_directly` function defined above. This approach proved stable and functional. The LangChain agent code cells have been removed from the main flow to ensure notebook runnability for the Capstone submission."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the creation of a Web3 Security Researcher AI Assistant using Google's Gemini Pro model. Key capabilities included:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Direct LLM Interaction:** Successfully used the `google-generativeai` library to analyze Solidity code based on a detailed system prompt and contextual information.\n",
    "* **Function Calling Simulation:** Implemented custom Python tools (`VulnerabilityAnalysisTool`, `GasOptimizerTool`) using `langchain-core`'s `BaseTool` structure, simulating function calling by running these tools directly and feeding their structured output (JSON) into the LLM prompt.\n",
    "* **RAG Implementation:** Created a knowledge base of vulnerabilities, generated embeddings using `models/embedding-001`, performed similarity searches, and included retrieved context in the LLM prompt to enhance analysis accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges & Workarounds:**\n",
    "Significant challenges were encountered with the `langchain-google-genai` library wrapper within the Kaggle environment, leading to persistent hangs during API calls. Workarounds like setting `NO_GCE_CHECK=True` resolved issues for direct library calls but not for the LangChain wrapper. Consequently, the primary analysis pathway uses direct SDK calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Work:**\n",
    "* Resolve LangChain wrapper compatibility issues (possibly requiring library updates or reporting bugs).\n",
    "* Expand the vulnerability knowledge base and RAG capabilities.\n",
    "* Integrate more sophisticated static analysis techniques (e.g., Slither output) as tool inputs.\n",
    "* Develop more comprehensive evaluation metrics.\n",
    "* Explore integration with on-chain data via blockchain explorers."
